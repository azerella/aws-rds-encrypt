> Python script to safely encrypt unencrypted AWS RDS instances with minimal downtime.

Currently, [AWS RDS instances are limited when it comes to enabling encryption for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Limitations). One must create an encrypted snapshot copy of the active instance, restore a new instance with said snapshot then redirect the active unencrypted instance to the newly created encrypted instance. This process can be confusing and time consuming, so why not automate it? üòÅ

# Prerequisites

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#key-terms)

# Configuration

This script replies on two things to be configured prior to executing: 

1. Having a local `~/.aws/credentials` file with relevant access keys and profile names for different enviornmnets. This can be easily created using the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) and running `aws configure`.

2. Relevant environment variables are set:

```bash
export PROFILE_NAME="prod"                                                          # Profile name used to interact with RDS.
export RDS_KMS_ID="arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456:key/abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop-qrstuvwxyz" # IAM encryption key used to encrypt RDS snapshots.
```

# Install
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Start
```python
python src/main.py
```

Sample output should be similar to:
```text
Instance: abc                 Encrypted: False
Instance: cde                 Encrypted: True
Instance: fgh                 Encrypted: False
